# Object Oriented Programming in Java
> I learned the principles of Object Oriented Programming, how to harness existing libraries' capabilities, create graphical user interfaces, and  employ essential algorithms for finding and sorting data.

Specifically, I learned how to do the following in this course:
1. Author a class in Java and explain how objects are constructed, how they store data, and how to define their actions.
2. Trace the execution of code using memory-models.
3. Define the scope of variables and methods.
4. Extend existing libraries to build a medium-sized project.
5. Implement user interface features.
6. Build and work with a class hierarchy that has multiple levels.
7. Explain “is-a” and “has-a” relationships between objects.
8. Author code which implements an Interface.
9. Explain the difference between compile-time and run-time decisions when working with polymorphism.
10. Explain the difference between event-driven programming and imperative programming.
11. Use searching and sorting to design algorithms for analyzing data.
12. Search for an element in a sorted and unsorted list and explain the differences.
13. Explain multiple sorting techniques and performance tradeoffs.
